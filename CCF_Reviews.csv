rsVqYKtEZykBZqwur6QyVw,HFFiM63x9asevqVOZG5GBQ,L8rJht4Jw_BuR8gsckEWYg,5.0,0,0,0,"Famous for its cheesecake and infamous for its two-hour waits, I must admit up front that I had no intention of liking this restaurant. I considered it to be over hyped and overrated; however, after a very satisfying early Saturday lunch, I now feel completely different.

We arrived at 11:00AM and were seated immediately, fortunately in Melissa's section. We had a $50 gift card to play with. We started things off with a very tasty beet and goat cheese salad for $7.95. Fresh and warm honey wheat and sourdough loaves were also served and were very satisfying.

For our entrees, my wife ordered the smoked salmon which was thinly sliced and doused with a balsamic glaze for $11.95, and I ordered the French country salad with chicken for $15.95. Both were quite good. We intentionally kept things light, knowing that we were each going to do some serious damage to cheesecake for dessert. 

As an admitted dessert snob, I did have my doubts regardless of the fact that cheesecake was their specialty. I never consider any dessert unless it's made in house and most of the time they are not.

After drooling over the choices on the menu and in the display case, we finally settled on the Oreo and the praline. Slices are huge and run a very reasonable $7.95 when compared to similar restaurants. More importantly, they were other worldly! The Oreo cheesecake had fresh crunchy Oreos baked in, an Oreo crust and was topped with crushed Oreos and fresh whipped cream. The praline was equally as good and was topped with Nutella and fresh creme. No we didn't finish them both but we sure did enjoy them there and at home. I am nonsmoker, and never have, but I almost had to have a cigarette afterwards. Yes it was that good!

Hey what can I say, I was wrong. No wonder people wait 2 hours to dine here. I won't do that anywhere no matter how great but I will return for another 11:00 Saturday lunch. By the way, when we left at 1:00 there was a 2 hour wait.

Overall, menu was huge, the food was great, the cheesecake incredible, service provided by Melissa was attentive and helpful, and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun. And on top of everything else, it had a 96 sanitary rating. There's no way I can give it anything but five stars! And of course it is a Gotta Try!",2017-02-09 04:06:45
T5dE90hplvP7UWQqYxYMTg,K1osyO04_hXoDKyGqe_V2Q,L8rJht4Jw_BuR8gsckEWYg,2.0,0,0,0,"I want to preface this review by admitting I didn't want to come here and I don't like chain restaurants like this, but someone we were going out to eat with really wanted to go here.

The restaurant was crazy busy and it's huge, so it was really loud.  The tables are like a faux-marble type material, so when the bus-boys were setting the tables and throwing down the utensils repeatedly, the sounds got real old fast.

We went here for lunch  and got the nachos with chicken as our app.  There was literally 5 random pieces of chicken on the nachos and it was gross and the flavoring was super sweet, which is weird to put on nachos.  The chips were saturated in grease and I'm not really sure why...

I ordered the Monterrey Burger to be cooked medium.  It was burnt\/charred in some spots and completely brown throughout the burger.  It wasn't that great.  The arugula it came with was put on top of the hot burger, so it was all wilted and not the best consistency.  I only ate half my burger.  

We all got cheesecake since we felt like we kind of had to.  I ordered the Oreo cheesecake and it fell short IMO.  The cheesecake itself was delicious! However, it was covered in thick chocolate cake and it was so rich - I didn't eat that part.

Overall, it was pretty much what I expected from a place like this.",2013-06-24 15:00:55

Our waiter, Joe, was honest with me when I asked him what his favorite cocktails were, and his favorite entree. He recommended the pineapple mojito which was delicious and the shepherds pie, which was probably one of the best meals I've had out to eat ever! Awesome service and food :)",2016-12-19 07:12:54

When we were seated our waitress was very friendly at first. She was very attentive (which she should be considering how expensive this restaurant is). I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and when it came out it looked delicious. It tasted absolutely HORRIBLE... It was loaded down with garlic and it ended up making me throw-up sick. I called the manager over and he didn't offer to take it off the check or anything. I told him to just bring me a burger to go. The waitress came back out about 30 minutes later with the burger and it wasn't in a to-go box. I had to ask her to bring me a box for it and she had an attitude. I said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said ""you're welcome"" or anything very polite back. Whenever I said ""thank you"" she just turned away. She wasn't horribly rude, but I definitely expect more for such an expensive restaurant. After we left, about 30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. I won' be coming back... This restaurant is not at all what it is talked up to be!!",2014-04-19 14:11:00

We waited approx 1hr, didnt leave because we knew all the other restaurants would have the same wait time. Once we were seated it went all down hill from there. We didnt get a ""hey how are U"" nor good afternoon, The waitress Whitney K. acted as if we were a bother the whole time. I ordered the veggie appetizer, had to ask for sauce, then I ordered the fish and chips-  asked her if I could substitute the the cole slaw, she said ""no its a Garnish and we cant do that"". She never asked if I wanted to maybe pay extra for a salad or maybe another item. I had to ask for vinegar for my fish, not really understanding at this point why I didnt jus pay and leave. I was so done so no matter what she said or did I wasnt hearing it. Next I asked for the manager, he proceeded to listen and apologize. 

The food really wasnt good after all this mishap, we paid and I left no Tip, which I have never done, this could have been my child. But I feel U should give 100% at work at all times, if not GO home, plenty of people need a job. Im not always happy at work either but I make sure I dont reflect this in my service to the public. Once a manager or owner of a business has mastered this with there employees U will have happy customers who will wait and return. I went to Olive Garden the next day, and the staff were all 100% my waiter earned the 20% I left him. I never asked for anything, he was very professional and they were busy on Memorial Day!!

Now this tops it off, before leaving I saw Miss Whitney show my receipt to the manager, I left no TIP, she made a weird face to him....really do U expect me to leave my hard earned money to someone who was rude to my family???  I wont return, my coins will B spent elsewhere....ENUFFSAID",2016-05-31 01:54:07

We started with Tuna Tartare, which was beautifully presented and very fresh. We loved it, and it was a nice diversion from some of their ""not so healthy"" appetizers. For lunch, I ordered my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the S.O. ordered teriyaki chicken. Both were excellent! Our server was awesome and we really had a great lunch with several drinks.

First, I cannot get over the fact that this place tries to pass itself off as fancy (valet parking, for example) when it is a) called ""The Cheesecake Factory"" and b) ATTACHED TO A MALL--arguably two of the least fancy things imaginable.  

The inside of this place is basically a glorified cafeteria--just a loud din of noise, which makes it even crazier that people dress up to go here. The food itself (even that which is not cheesecake related) is incredibly caloric and fattening.  I spent most of my life trying to avoid this place, and, I realized today, for good reason--this place is just thoughtless excess at its finest.",2011-02-13 21:57:55

The wait was an hour (as usual) but we were promptly seated at an hour. Our server was very quick and courteous. We were seated in the far left corner of restaurant by window and it was awesome and quiet! I got the shepherds pie and it was delicious as always. The only thing that drove us a bit crazy was the Coke we ordered tasted like Diet Coke for our first refill, then when we mentioned it, the third tasted like Coke Zero! Weird! I stopped drinking soda this month so serves me right I guess... :(

   The waiter was fantastic. He had a great sense of humor and was very observant. The bartender knows how to make a mean amaretto sour. 
   Can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and not order cheesecake..... The choices go on and on. I decided on the cherry cheesecake and I was not disappointed. It was good to the last bite.

I really coulda just had that - since it's was like a grilled cheese - an awesome high brow grilled cheese cut into 4 strips! I'm only giving 3 stars cause the pasta a order was ok. Basic.

We came tonight for my moms birthday and I get the appeal for her. She's a midwestern bland food kind of person. Nothing wrong with that, but I am the exact opposite so I only find it ""ehhh"". The menu is insanely large and overwhelming. Seriously, I've never seen a restaurant have so many options and I'm not sure that's a good thing either. The prices are also very high, however one entree is enough food for two people so it evens out... Seriously the portions are ENORMOUS. I finally decided on the Parmesan crusted chicken and it came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The chicken tasted good but the Parmesan crust was soggy. The green beans were bland and underdone but the mashed were very good. It did take forever to get our food. This is definitely not the place to go if you're in a hurry. I love their pineapple upside down cheesecake however it's seasonal and not available... I haven't had it in years so it may not even be a thing anymore. I opted for the original; not bad but obviously comes in frozen and then thawed for sale. My mom got the key lime cheesecake and I wasn't a fan. I prefer New York style cheesecake and this was really thin. However if you prefer the thinner version you will love it and huge bonus point the whipped cream is homemade and not from a can!!

I had the shrimp and chicken gumbo and was able to get brown rice with that which is great. The menu has plenty of burgers, sandwiches, steaks, burritos, etc. good selection of salads as well.

We had sun dried tomato pasta and a pizza. Finished it off with Red Velvet Cheesecake....big enough to share, and OMG delicious!

With one of the most beautiful and unique decors I've seen, plus the South Park location, you just can't go wrong.  And where else do you go where the menu is literally like a small book?!

That huge menu selection can seem a bit overwhelming, so ask the servers for suggestions if you need to.  I really enjoy their small plates and find the selection to be nicely varied over several different styles of food.  Several of the menu selections are also inventive and fun.  If you're not on the small plates menu, make some room because the rest of the portions are what I like to call ""ginormous""!  Everything is good, though, every time.

Now, don't forget to flip to the back TWO pages of that menu-novella.  You MUST at least consider the decadence of a slice of cheesecake.  Overwhelmed again?  Just close your eyes and point, it's impossible to make a bad choice.  (Hmm.. maybe I like cheesecake more than I realized)

Being my 21st I kind of expected for the server to at least notice when I got carded and ordered drinks that it was my birthday and he didn't. The drinks were good though. My boyfriend told the server as he passed by that I was a little hurt and the climatic moment I had been waiting for was ruined and he admitted that he only checked the year. 

Overall the food was meh. I got the steak Diane and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes. They must pre plate the potatoes when you get the combinations because it turned into a molded shape in the middle. The shrimp and steak were bleh and I can't even complain that I only received 3 shrimps and 3 steak medallions because they weren't very good. Boyfriend got the teriyaki chicken and it was fatty. He said it was alright but the menu says it comes with a plantain. They had a grilled banana on it- maybe they expect people to not know the difference? 

Cheesecake was very good though. 

I will never be visiting again. The server did the bare minimum. We left spending $115 including tip but the boyfriend was charged $121. Even though it's $6, that's sketchy. Boyfriend called the manager and the manager said to call his bank because he saw that we were charged $115 but he had to keep explaining that he was over charged. I work at a restaurant and the boyfriend has a chef for a brother so we both are familiar with the service industry and I will never eat at a place with servers bold enough to readjust tips that have a manager that could care less.",2014-05-27 13:02:46

30 minute wait, which I guess in the grand scheme of Cheesecake Factory wait times wasn't too bad.  The people watching during the wait is always interesting and the massive amounts of food and cheesecake that pass me always make me wonder what kind of money this place makes.

The service was great, very attentive and friendly.  One thing I do like is the variety of food offered which is both good and bad, I guess.  We had the avocado eggrolls which are pretty tasty, I don't want to know how many calories were in them but nice chunks of avocado fried in an egg roll wrapper were complimented by a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.

I had the mushroom burger which frankly was very good.  It was well put together with very flavorful mushrooms and swiss cheese.  The cover the burger in some kind of wine sauce which was welcomed.  Fries....nasty.  Too much salt ruined them.

My server was excellent and after an issue with a dish, the manager who visited my table also went way beyond what most would have bothered with, in particular since it's The Cheesecake Factory and losing one customer would seemingly not be a big deal, since I arrived at 5:15 on a Thursday evening to a packed house.  

I haven't been to the Factory in years.  I don't like going to the mall and I don't like waiting an inordinate amount of time to be seated.  I had a craving for cheesecake, so I made a run here after work.  Since it's attached to SouthPark mall, there seems to never be any down time at all.  Even upon my early arrival I had to wait a few minutes to be seated.  No biggie, I was seated within 5 or so minutes and instantly greeted by my server, Bonnie, who was absolutely fantastic.  She had her hands full and the section was completely booked, but she did a fantastic job.  I heard a table near me compliment how well she did, after she returned to thank them for what I assume was an extra-large tip.

The food:
Fried cheese sticks:  6 triangles.  Thick breading, nice melty cheese.  Marinara that was served with was meh.  Tasted weird, kind of plain, but nothing offensive.  
Fried chicken salad:  When they first opened this location, this was my go-to order.  Huge ""normal"" salad with fried chicken on top of it.  In the many years it has been since my last visit, the recipe has changed and I was not a fan of the new way.  The menu said ""mixed greens"" and I forgot that kale is no longer just a garnish.  Too much kale, way too much kale.  But the fried chicken served with it was quite good, as was the corn and pecans with the honey mustard dressing.  I picked through the salad, but it was mostly kale, so I just ate the chicken.  My server noticed and said she would bring me something else, but I told her it was my misunderstanding, no big deal, I ate all of the chicken and a few pieces of lettuce and that was fine.  
Turtle cheesecake:  Eh.... it was okay.  Creamy cheesecake with a healthy swirl of whipped cream.  Large dollop of a thick chocolate cream on top, plenty of nuts.  It was fine.  

The server let the manager (I believe he said his name was Johann) know about the salad and he came by the table and told me that had been taken off of my bill.   I told him as well that it wasn't necessary as I ate all of the chicken and what I could of the salad.  He again said it was taken care of and if I had any other problems to let him know.  Very nice and totally unexpected.  Excellent customer service.

I don't know when I will return, but the great job by my waitress and the manager on duty definitely left a very positive reflection on the place, I just wish the food was as good as the staff.",2013-07-16 01:36:50

we get there at 8:30pm. we were politely greeted and immediately say. first thing, something I have noticed before but didn't write a review because we've never had a bad experience, but the FLOOR. the floor here is SO slick you can easily fall and get seriously hurt, so a message to corporate: fix this before you find yourself in a lawsuit. 
now to the overall experience which is why I'm here. now off the gate, our waiter was good and our drinks were 8.5\/10 so no complaints there. the food though? my husband ordered the filet and I ordered the shrimp\/steak combo. my husband ordered his steak medium and I ordered mine medium rare. once we received our food and cut into them, my husband's steak was closer to rare but he ended up keeping it, but left about 3\/4 uneaten because once it cooled off he found it an edible. my (medallions, not actually steak which the menu didn't say) were WELL done. I sent them back and said I would just take the filet and pay the difference. the waiter politely said he would do that. we waited close to 20min. to get my replate, once I cut into it, it was so rare that it was cool in the center. once again, sent the plate back. got the 2nd once back much faster but after waiting and was better. but after waiting so long to eat, I really wasn't hungry anymore so I took a few bites and took it to go. both times, the waiter brought the plates, never spoke to a manager yet two different ones cleared our plates without a word about the food. 
my husband ordered a whole cheesecake that we after found out they only had a few slices left of, which we ended up getting anyway. my husband proceeded to pay and I went to the restroom which, was disgusting. 
the first two toilets were clogged, trash on the floor, and no soap in one of the dispensers, hardly any in the other.

I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious. 
I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all.

It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.

Yes, it's a chain and yes there's tons of local eats, but I argue that there is no place where a party of 20 people can get everything they're looking for, no matter what they like, what dietary restrictions they have and what they're in the mood for.

The mood lighting at night is great for a romantic dinner that isn't too intimate (no pressure!) or a nightcap and cheesecake (sexy!). The hours are later than most other places in the area, too, so if you're running to grab a bite after a movie or something, the Factory is a great option.

I tend to battle between getting the Thai Lettuce Wraps (fresh, quality, delish!) and the BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad, no cucumbers, but almost always get both because I can't stop myself. Sure it's way too much food but these are things that I sometimes DREAM about. And sure there are vietnamese and thai places that carry the lettuce wraps in town but I've tried and every time I'm left yearning for that tamarind cashew sauce. 

BRB, drooling.

And, I'm back! So yes, the service is always attentive but the waits can be long, especially at peak dinner hours and all day Saturday & Sunday during mall hours. The bar is fully stocked, bathrooms always clean (and posh!), and the outdoor patio makes for a pretty nice summer lunch spot too.

You could get something spectacular one night and order the same dish again the next night and not get the same quality.

I went there with the lady and another couple to celebrate achievements on all of our parts. The girls ordered drinks, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  And then the food came out.

I ordered...uh... some jamaican jerk thing? With chicken instead of shrimp? Jeez, it's so hard to remember when the menu is that big. I'm sure that there are a bunch of jamaican jerk things with chicken. But this one had beans and a mango pineapple salsa! And plantains!  The chicken was excellent, the slaw was good (but room temp, not cold), the beans were okay (they lacked seasoning), and the yucca was seriously overcooked. I was with my Irish buddy who had never seen plantains before and he asked me if I ordered shit (yes, they were that charred and shriveled. I gotta say, I don't blame him). However, it's really hard to mess up the internal flavor of a plantain, and overall, it was fine.

The lady ordered Fish Tacos, and she was not pleased. But I can't blame her, they had soaked the damn thing is so much sauce that the actual tortilla broke when she tried to pick it up because it was too saturated. She said it also lacked any flavor, though I didn't try it.

The cheesecake IS consistently wonderful though. I do wish they gave a weeee bit bigger slices, but what can you do.

But of the chains, I have a special fondness for the Cheesecake Factory. Back at my old job in Virginia I would take clients out to lunch quite often, and where did they always want to go? The Cheesecake Factory. Have gone there so much, I really got to try a variety of different dishes, from the salads, to the pastas, to the steaks, salmon, burgers, sandwiches, etc. I tend to order the louisiana chicken pasta or a steak. Or one of their great salads if it's lunch time. 

I was never a fan of restaurants with such an extensive menu, but Cheesecake does a good job. I cannot recall ordering anything that I didn't like. Don't get me wrong, I can't recall ordering a dish and thinking that it was my favorite ever, but Cheesecake is pretty consistent. And their portions are large so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. That's why I think it's always busy on Weekends for lunch and dinner. There really is a lot to choose from, which is good when you have a group of people that can't decide on cuisine that night. 

The service isn't bad. I think that people in general need to understand that when a restaurant is super busy sometimes the level of service dips a little bit. And not all server is created equal. In every restaurant there are servers who move more efficiently, make few mistakes, and...well...for a lack of a more eloquent way to put it...are just better than others. And unless you're a regular you probably won't know who's who. Having waited tables in the past I probably tend to have more patience with service. That being said I've had great service on weekends and off-peak hours here than I did on the weekend dinners that were had here. coincidence? I doubt it. 

Not much needs to be said about the cheesecake. It's always terrific.

On my way to Virginia over the holidays, we drove through Charlotte specifically so that we could go to CF.  

This location of CF is by far, the best I have ever been.  We had an awesome booth all the way in the back (read -- away from all the noise).  Our server was friendly and helpful. 

The food at this location was great!  Hot, huge portions and there was no skimping when we asked for extra sauce for our dishes (a must if you are a sauce freak like we are).

My daughter had her usual farfalle pasta (chicken, mushrooms, peas and some other stuff) and I had the chicken madeira (chicken, mozzarella, madeira sauce, asparagus and smashed taters).  It was all soooooooooooooo delicious!!  

We ordered one cheesecake -- the banana -- which is served with freshly sliced bananas.  It's now my second favorite to the lemon with raspberry glaze.  

When CF comes to Baton Rouge or New Orleans, my life will be complete.  Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I will be stupendously thrilled.

My recommendations --  Thai lettuce wraps (enough for a meal or appetizer to share) and then something from the specialties page, pasta or salad.  Skip the stuff that you can get anywhere any day of the week (burger).",2013-01-06 00:46:12

I had the pleasure of taking my entire family (wife and 5 children - 14, 10, 10, 7, 5) plus a 6 yo friend of my 7 yo daughter to eat at CF for my 7 year old's birthday dinner. I realize it was 7pm on a Wed night (not a weekend night), but it was still busy. So - it was crazy, to say the least - loud, annoying, yelling, constant battles between the boys, unnecessary comments and touching, eye rolls and sighs...you know the drill.

But CF and my server were FANTASTIC and handled it all with serious grace and professionalism. 

Look - the food at CF is good. Very good. Yes, the Factory Burrito is flippin huge and enough for an entire village to eat. Yes, their cheesecakes are absurdly large and delish. Yes, their menu is a bit overpriced, especially some of the kids' meals. But it is truly hard to complain due to the quality of the food.

But my issues with CF in the past have almost entirely been about service. Not THIS time, however. 

I got there early to get a table (b\/c they still have that stupid ""no reservation"" rule, ugh). The Hostess was very nice and went out of her way to help, even making sure my name stayed at the top of the list while I waited for my family to arrive (2 cars). We were settled into a large, round booth-thing. ONE SERIOUS ISSUE - the booth's seat fabric was TERRIBLE. It was literally missing in multiple places with stuffing popping out. Unreal. It wasn't uncomfortable or anything, just VERY ugly and not what I expect for Southpark and the prices they charge.

Anyway - our server was amazing. She was constantly there, getting constant refills for my camel-like kids, never getting upset about all the yelling and things being spilled. She got our food out ASAP and was always (somehow) happy to help us with the (stupidest) requests from my children (including needing crayons to color - which she somehow found - and paper). I honestly cannot say enough about her and the rest of the staff there.

They have an extensive menu which I have tried a lot of, but Kevin and I have found the two dishes that we love and get every single time!  When we have a gift card, we usually get each dish, but if we don't, we usually get the combo, as these two dishes also come as a combo.  Great amount for us to share!  We of course love it when we have a gift card so that we can have it for multiple nights!  What are the dishes?  Chicken madeira and steak Dianne!  Both the chicken and steak are awesome.  We love the potatoes too!  If you get the chicken madeira, ask for extra sauce on the side because it is fantastic to pour on the mashed potatoes!

We are full by the time we are done, so we always take our cheesecake to go.  Can't go there without getting cheesecake as it is awesome and cheesecake is my favorite!

One good thing is the appetizer menu - I could make a meal out of most stuff on there and not feel quite as stuffed.  The fried mac and cheese is good, and so are the pot stickers.

The server Leticia started off decent.... she didn't know how to discuss one of the entrees with my cousin and was coming off very rude and stand off ish. On a Monday night we waited approximately 35-40 minutes on our food. Our water was empty for almost 30 mins while we waited for our food that had to be sent back several times. My aunt ordered a pasta dish that had a basil drizzle as a garnish (that was not listed) and sent it back, it took 20 mins to receive that entree (everyone was finished with their meal). There was many server errors within this experience such as bringing sauce when food is complete, not enagaging in our request, slamming spoons on the table for dessert, the list can go on. My biggest issue is ordering a salmon for  $21 and it was cold...which is ok however, when I asked for it to be sent back, when it came back to the table the entree was STILL cold! At this point I wanted to talk to a manger or something, CJ the manager who came over had every excuse in the book as to why my salmon, mashed potatoes, asparagus and cream sauce was borderline freezing (as if taken out of the cooler). He was standing there kind of going back and forth with myself and my cousin (both of which are server) trying to justify my cold dish. I specifically told him to make me a BRAND new piping hot salmon and I want it to go because we are on a time constraint and we have to leave. 2-5 minutes later he shows up with my ORIGINAL salmon in a to go container over a plate and it is STILL cold. I am pissed the h**l off! 
This night was supposed to be an amazing night for my family and I and turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had or one that I've ever seen. To top it off this fool comped my dessert as well as my aunts food but my Salmon that had issue was still on the bill. 
Because I know how this industry works paying $158 for this experience is not sitting well with me and I do not recommend this location whatsoever, this restaurant was very unprofessional and unpleasant as if it was their first day on the job.

The food?  It's good.  I've never had the issues the other reviewers are calling the ""6 o'clock sweats"".  But the food here does seem to have some quality that leaves me feeling completely saturated.  Maybe it's one of those places that makes your eyes fall out of your head when you see the nutritional facts on their food.  
Whatever the case, the menu is pretty diverse.  I've eaten about a dozen times split between the two 'Factory restaurants I've visited and only been disappointed once.  

Their cheesecake is pretty unique.  I can down a slice of cheesecake in a sitting pretty easily, but the cake from here takes me at least 3 attempts to finish it.  But that's a good thing.  It packs all the flavor (and calories, I'm sure) of 3 slices of your typical cheesecake into one slice.  

The service has always been very good, even when it's packed, (which is often.)
Their beer list is usually pretty decent.  They usually have the typical summer wheat, a couple lagers, a dark and one or two ""local"" brews, (for Charlotte, that means Yuengling.  Chicago was Goose Island.)  Nothing extravagant, but their beer selection does a good job of matching the light, stylish mood of the restaurant.

It's pricey, but I don't come here when I'm searching for a good value.  I come when I'm looking for a reliable menu and a lot of atmosphere.

Not the downtown casinos that are all closed in and almost claustrophobic, mind you, but the expansive Steve Wynn casinos on the strip.  It's huge.  It borders on gaudy, but in a nice way.  You also can't really tell what time of day it is - probably so you don't mind how long you wait for your server to come back to you (though we did).

I'd imagine that during the day, the monstrous windows in the front of the place give it a ton of light, and it would be a completely different feel, but at night, it just gave that vibe.  The noise is pretty incredible too - like the old noise of casinos (they don't have noise any more, sad to say).

As to the food - pretty impressive overall.  I just wish that they didn't have 300 items on the menu.  And I didn't count, the server gave that number when I asked for a suggestion since I didn't feel like opening the tome of selections.  I eventually settled on one of the items from the specials list (Caramel Chicken).

We also had some crab cake appetizers, a massive double BBQ burger, a chicken sandwich and an order of popcorn shrimp.  The fried food overall was the worst.  The burger was good, but huge.  The crab cakes were surprisingly good.   It was really the service that did them in, but to their credit the manager (or someone doing an imitation of a manger) came out to tell us that the food would be out some time.  Then we had to also wait on the bill, and to pay the bill, and so on...

If I had any suggestions, it would be for them to go on ""Kitchen Nightmares"" with Gordon Ramsay.  Not because the place isn't clean - it's immaculate.

They could even shave something off the price at the same time.

That way every person wouldn't be walking out with leftovers and they wouldn't have to spend so much time at every table trying to help diners navigate the menu.  Not to mention, there would be room for dessert.  You know, the cheesecake?",2009-11-04 13:14:14

(We don't have one in Greensboro, NC). Sure, it's not ""fine dining"", but the food is always good and the portions are so large! With that said, my sister threw me a baby shower at this location on 2\/13\/16. They don't take reservations per se, but my sister was assured, 3 weeks ahead of time, that they would hold the back room open for our party of 25. My sister called the morning of the shower to make sure everything was still a go. This was around 10:45 am and she was notified that there was already a line of patrons outside the door. We hurried to the restaurant and arrived around 11:30 am and were told that the room and tables we were promised had already been taken!!

We decided to stay and wait, as invitations had been mailed out, and it was too late to change locations. Suffice it to say, we did not get seated until after 1 pm. This was difficult for me because I am 9 months pregnant and hadn't eaten because I never anticipated the wait.

The hostess was less than helpful and gave us a pager to wait like the other 25 parties there! Dissatisfied, I grabbed a manager who was gracious enough to rectify the situation. 

Our waitress was kind and pretty attentive. Our entree selections included shepherd's pie, shrimp scampi without tomatoes that arrived with tomatoes, kids' pizza and a Cuban sandwich. Everything tasted ok. If you do have the shrimp pasta, know that it comes with five shrimp, not many noodles and barely any ""sauce"". Oh and we did have a good appetizer, the buffalo blasts!

I've had better for a lot cheaper at food trucks. I think everything on the menu is way overpriced and there are just way too many items to choose from. 

I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake. 

The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception.

We have noticed several service issues, especially when dining in the bar area.  At our last outing, our server took almost 10 minutes to come to the table after we sat down to greet us, pass out menus and take drink orders. She was slow to bring drinks, didn't bring a side salad that was requested before the meal. The food was subpar, and they totally botched my order by giving me the wrong dish.  Everyone's food also arrived lukewarm, like it had been sitting for a while.

We did address it with the manager who was apologetic and discounted the bill. We were treating an out of town guest who had never been to CF before and were totally embarrassed that we had brought him here. We walked out thinking we should have gone somewhere else in the South Park area. Eating out is becoming more and more of a luxury and it is disappointing when you got out expecting a nice dining experience and  get bad service and bad food. We will not be returning to CF anytime soon and I can no longer recommend it.

Chocolate cake layer, cheesecake layer, chunck of chocolate on top, great whip cream, beautiful crunchy tofffee-ish crust.Absolutely wonderful experience.  If you ever go here and too much of a wait, the food court at this mall is great and you can bring your to-go slice of cheesecake to devour after your lunch at one of the great other spots in the food court or if just eating cheesecake they won't kick you out.

Your place looks pretty cool though, I like high ceilings, and I can appreciate the sizable outdoor patio area, but can we get tables that are a bit bigger please? It's really crowded!

Adjoined to Southpark Mall is the ubiquitous Cheesecake Factory. Every time I go for a shopping spree I see tons of people waiting their turn to get into this place like an exclusive nightclub and people leaving with bags of food. So I finally decided to try it out after a shopping spree one day. The place feels very cavernous walking in with super high ceilings and some paintings to gaze at as you're looking up wondering how much their power bill costs. Well then the waiting game begins, first we checked in to the hostess station and was told there will be about 45 minutes wait which turned out to be about an hour, okay no big deal I thought. Turns out the buzzer thing they gave me was to announce that I could now wait in the shorter line to actually be seated! What a tease!

So now we're finally seated and hungry looking at the huge menu. Some bread came out I guess to sate your hunger a bit from waiting an hour+ to get a seat. I ordered a frozen mango smoothie and appetizers took that took a while to come out by this time I'm wishing they gave me some more bread. The spicy ahi tempura roll that came out is huge and delicious but not spicy at all. Then came the main courses which actually came out on time! I had ordered the Cajun jambalaya pasta and was totally unprepared for the size of this thing. I mean seriously it would have taken 4 meals for me to finish this thing off, it was very delicious though! The sudden influx of food at once left me feeling really bloated though so we opted for taking dessert home and bought a tiramisu cheesecake for later.

I've probably rambled on too much at this point so I'll just summarize. Come prepared to be hungry in 1-2 hours and not while you're actually hungry. Prices are a bit high for the type of food but they give you enough food for 3-4 meals. I just don't really understand this place the food is nice but I there are plenty of dining options around this area where you don't have to wait for 2 hours.

The wine selection isn't that great and the wine we both ordered was horrible.

This place is obviously known for their cheesecake, in case you couldn't figure that out by the name of the restaurant, so I will start by talking about what they do best and move onto the meal from there. All slices of cheesecake are big and rich enough to share. These things are huge and if you're eating one by yourself then you are either a mammoth or your pig. Don't hate! Just embrace the truth! My wife and I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, which had Hulk testicle size chunks of cookie dough inside of the cheesecake. With two big squirts of whipped cream on the top and the tip of the cheesecake to complete the imagery that I'm shooting for. It was simply amazing!

When the waitress first stopped by to ask what we would like to drink I asked for water and an Old Fashioned. To which she replied ""How hot would you like that?"" That's when I learned that one of their burgers is called The Old Fashioned. As I write this I now realize that I should have ordered The Old Fashioned to go w\/ my Old Fashioned, but let me tell you what I did get before I get too carried away. I got Renee's Special which consisted of a Turkey Sandwich, the Soup of the Day (Clam Chowder) and a House Salad. Very tasty! My only complaint on the food was that the bread, I believe it was Sour Dough was too hard. Not stale or anything, just the crust was hard as a Hulk sized... ...never mind.

My Old Fashioned was very tasty and helped me take my mind off of the man taking his three disrespectful daughters out. This good man was taking his daughters out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and all three of them were on their phone and iPads.

I was able to dine one evening when they had the 15 minute wait time. Our buzzer went off and we were seated. The buzzer was greasy. I had hand sanitizer so I was okay. Not sure if it was wiped off between patrons in this flu season. Prior to being seated I had time to review the menu and use the restroom. The restrooms were semi clean. With the high percentage of guests they can clean more often. 

I placed my drink order upon being sat. For some odd reason I reminded my waiter twice about my drink order. He totally forgot it appeared. He seemed distracted. The table beside me had the same issue. The service just was non existent. Unfortunately service can make or break an experience.  

The menu was hilarious from glamburgers to skinnylicious. Someone who has an extra personality made this menu.  I had the grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The food was good. The salmon was a bit salty, but there was plenty to take home. The texture and temperature of my dish were great. I had the strawberry martini which was sweet and designed in a cute style. I had two meals due to the large portion size of the salmon dish. I decided to skip dessert. I was so full from dinner over eating wasn't in my plans.

After taking our orders, our waitress didn't check on us again until the food was served but but by that time my wife and I had no water just ice cubes sitting lonely in the bottom of our glass. I ordered the Miso Salmon and my wife ordered the Petite Filet. I wasn't pleased at all with the Salmon because it was pink in the middle and my wife didn't really care for the Filet because it wasn't cooked to order. We decided not to have the food sent back because it would've taken forever and two days to get the food back. 

The wait staff seemed like they could care less and on many occasions they were simply MIA. They tried to push desert on us but we were ready to go and get desert someplace else. This is not the type of service I expected because I've been to other Cheesecake locations across the states and this was the worst experience. The staff needs more customer focused training and being attentive not blind to the needs of your clients. I based on this experience couldn't recommend you to spend your money here unless you enjoy mediocre service.

I love adding food pictures (944 of them if you want to know) , but tonight there was no food, so inevitably there are no photos of food.     

Why you may ask?       

Well, let me explain.

It was around 9:45pm or so when we entered the restaurant, there were no lines or waiting, so we (my wife and I) were promptly seated in what I will refer to as man bun hell.

After being seated between two groups of folks along the bar seating area, we were just getting a taste of the evenings adventure as it took approx 5-6 minutes for our server to come over and take our drink order.  We ordered ONE Chicken Marsala to be split, It was not long after that our bread and water arrived, but that was all.  By now it was around 10pm as this was clearly stated by our guest at the table beside us as it was getting late and they were ready to leave.  It was about 5 minutes later that the table to the  right of us received their meals and they had time to finish their food even after ordering 5 deserts to go.  At last look, it was 10:38, we had run out of time, patience and understanding.  Our server appeared to be distracted by a table we will refer to as ""friends"" since he was at that table for at least ten minutes - socializing.

He did bring by an empty plate for us to share our meal should it ever arrive.  We received two refills during this time. At no time was an apology given for the lack of food coming from the kitchen.  The table to the right was cleaned and a new group of four guest were seated.  The hostess stated that they would be taken care of ""she promised""......I stated that ""they should not believe the lies"", as we were obviously not taken care of.  They brought this to their service attention, but our own server arrived and I made it clear that we were leaving.  He suggested that we speak to a manager, however it was too late.  I stopped by the hostess stand but the manager came by.

During this time, the server was observed laughing and showing no interest toward any guest.

Upon leaving the restaurant I called and was promptly placed on hold for seven minutes.

I understand busy nights, but this was just not the case.

I will be following up on this review........",2016-06-04 04:07:42

The food is occasionally very good, but most often it is merely serviceable--you'll eat it, you won't be hungry afterwards, but two days later you won't be able to recall what it was you ate. I suspect that has something to do with the extensive ""something for everybody"" menu, which makes me think no single kitchen could prepare all of these dishes with equal skill. Thus, some items might be sort of roughed out in the kitchen by the cooks, while others are done with flourish and panache.

It is a ridiculous amount of food presented on the plate, and I would be a more frequent guest there if the food cost 2\/3 as much and the portion was proportionately reduced. I likewise won't bother with a 20-40 minute wait--I'll eat in the food court, save myself about $30 for the wife and me (especially with no wine), and stop by on the way out for some cheesecake slices to go.

Finally, I prefer eating outside when the weather permits. It isn't a great view (the parking lot) but the noise level is much lower than inside. Modern restaurant designers seem to have a fetish for hard surfaces within the dining area, reflecting kitchen noise and patron conversation into an enormous dull din. Supposedly, this creates a sense of energy in the place; for me, it is more like eating in a construction site. If inside is all that is available, I'm heading back to that food court...",2010-10-24 20:54:05

-The waitstaff are extremely nice and very helpful.  You will never worry about your cup going dry!  They also get the food to you in a hurry so that it doesn't every get cold, if it isn't supposed to be, waiting to arrive at your table.  
-The bathrooms are always clean and fully stocked.  
-The bar is an awesome area where the bartender is super nice and can help you pick the perfect cocktail to complement your choice of cheesecake (or food).
-The food ranges from pasta to salads to seafood to anything you can think of.  There is no shortage of options when it comes to this menu!!  
Lastly, the music they play is always best enjoyed on the outside patio on a nice afternoon with a glass of wine.  The patio is my choice of seating!!  

My only critical review would be that the waiter who brought our cheesecakes to our table reeked of cigarette smoke.  Not such a big fan of the stuff and kind of makes me nauseated.  (Not really a feeling I'm going for after stuffing my face with awesome food)

This place is ALWAYS crowded during dinner time, if you come around 6-8 you will probably have to wait unless if you made a reservation, this is particularly true on the weekends. I have tried numerous appetizers, pasta entree, burger entree, and cheesecake desserts. Overall, the flavor of the food is great, the presentation is also commendable and the portion is very large. Because of the large portion, on some of their dishes they offer 1\/2 sizes. The interior decoration is very nice, 2 floor high ceiling, golden deco, very spacious and many different sections. They have a full bar overlooking a great view. When you order pasta, they always bring out parmasan and shred it right in front of you. Love their pesto and sundries tomatoes. They also always bring put a basket of wheat and white bread after you order. Entrees range around 12-18 dollar. Appetizers around $8-12. Their appetizers are pretty big too, i ordered the avocado spring rolls once and i was able to eat it as an entree. The avocado spring rolls are amazing, i highly recommend them. They are different than any other spring rolls you've had. Perfect flavor and consistency over a crispy shell. If i remembered correctly, there are 6 large half pieces of spring rolls. The cheesecakes are around $6-8 per piece. Very large size served on a large plate, can be shared among 2-3 people.

The waitress brought us some bread, but it was cold and not a full order. We looked to the table next to us with the same amount of people and they had twice as much as us. We love the bread here and always look forward to it. Even after we finished our bread, we were never asked once if we wanted some more. 

Before we got there, I had it in my head what I wanted, since the menu rarely changes. I have almost all 1,334 pages memorized. Undoubtably, I wanted some of the fried Mac n Cheese balls. Also, knowing that the portions can sometimes be rather large, I decided I wanted the chicken tenders. They say they are Cajun, but as someone who grew up eating Cajun cuisine, nothing about the feels Cajun. I just wanted them because I knew they would bring me a mountain of them. 

Once the food came, I was ready to climb the plate. The chicken tenders came with succotash and an order of mashed potatoes. Everything was just as good as it's been in the past. Also, when I say they bring you a mountain of food, be prepared to have plenty left over for the next day (or so). 

My wife and I split the lemon raspberry cheesecake (had no clue they even had this) and it was amazing. It's now my favorite cheesecake flavor. I can't wait to have it again

I think the cheesecakes are worth the money, they are delicious, but the actual food is really not. I'd enjoy the experience more if it wasn't so pricey. I usually don't dine here but a friend of mine wanted to for the cheesecake. 

The service is so so. Our waiter smelt of cigarettes which was a super buzz kill and really unappealing because we were about to eat. He came and went really quickly just to take our orders and serve the food but we never got a refill. We hardly saw him. I'd also like to mention that the floor is always slippery at every Cheesecake Factory I've ever been too and this one is no exception.

We ordered the mac and cheese balls, cheese and spinach dip and southwest chicken rolls. Everything was really good though the cheese and spinach dip could have benefited with some seasoning. The mac and cheese balls and the southwest chicken rolls were very hearty, we had to take a lot of food home with us. 

What I did not like was how much the Long Island Iced Tea costs (I docked 1.5 stars for this), I blew $10.70 for a watered down drink. It did not feel like that much alcohol was in there. I won't be buying drinks from here again. 

The half off THE FIRST SLICE of cheesecake was a great deal, my boyfriend and I each bought a slice. I got the caramel turtle while he got the tiramisu. The caramel turtle was amazing, wasn't too cream cheesy and had the right amount of sweetness. The tiramisu was just meh, I wouldn't get it again.

First off,  the restaurant is very nice looking.  I liked the ambiance from my point of view in the lobby.  When we were seated... not as much.  We were tucked in this little alley off to the side of the bar that led to what I'm sure was a nicer room that looked out into the parking lot.  We couldn't see much from where we were sitting except the waiters running back and forth and the little area where they entered orders on the computer. 

But I'm jumping ahead... we got there a few minutes before 7 and had to wait 45 minutes for a table for 2.  Some people coming in after us were told up to an hour and a half! I know this because the pager\/beeper they give you is only active IN their lobby.  So there were about 50-70 people all standing around this lobby starring at each other and the cheesecake in the case.  Not cool.

Finally our beeper went off and then we were told to stand in a certain spot to wait for our name to be called. More waiting.  Then we were taken to our little alley table.

The menu is 21 pages long.  And then there is a Skinnylicious menu on top of that. Ridiculous.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip.  It was fine.  I've had better.

I ordered the Pasta Carbonara with Chicken.  It was OK. Again... I've had better.
Boyfriend got the Bistro Shrimp Pasta: Crispy Battered Shrimp, Fresh Mushrooms, Tomato and Arugula Tossed with Spaghettini and a Basil-Garlic-Lemon Cream Sauce
I didn't taste it but he said it was fine but nothing he would crave again later - and that he liked another pasta dish from another restaurant much better.
We each ordered a slice of cheesecake.  I got the Chocolate mouse cheesecake which I thought would be light and fluffy but no.  It was very heavy.

It was very expensive in my opinion.  We both got water, we shared an app, each had an entree and a piece of cheesecake and this came to $71 after tip.  For what we got? It was not worth it at all.   2 stars on Yelp means ""Meh. I've experienced better."" That is exactly right in this case.  We will most definitely not be back.",2012-11-18 00:22:54

We went on a Friday night around 8 and only had about a 15-20 minute wait. We were seated and our waiter seemed very nice at first and told us to take our time and soak in everything. I was amazed at the menu, it had anything and everything you could possibly want and then some.  The fried Mac & Cheese balls were AMAZBALLS and our food was delicious. 
I was very disappointed with our service though, he started off great, and I don't know what happened, but it seemed like we were bothering him by sitting in his section. He treated the other two tables he was waiting on very different and was super friendly but any time he came to the table we had to request refills on drinks and he just never checked in at all. This was a huge disappointment because like I said I had super high expectations coming in.   

Bad Service aside, the Cheesecake is to DIE for!!!!! Oh My Goodness, My husband tried the original cheesecake, but I had to go all in. I got the Chris' Outrageous Cheesecake and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  It was a layer of brownie, topped with a coconut chocolate chip cheese cake, topped with chocolate cake, and if that wasn't fat enough it also had a coconut pecan frosting on it.  Yes it was a completely fat *ss item, but it was so worth it. I would stay on the elliptical all day to have that once a week. 

Overall it was an ok experience.  The food was AMAZING, but the service was very disappointing. :( I will definitely  give it another try and for sure at least get some cheesecake to go.",2015-09-07 02:46:01

I'm not sure if it's the fancy cocktails or the ridiculously expansive menu followed by the most decadent cheesecake, but I always feel so fancy when I come here. 

This location is easy to find, but it's connected to Southpark mall so parking can be a bit of a nightmare. The inside is beautiful with cathedral ceilings, ample seating for dining, and a really nice bar area. I wish they had more seating for the waiting area because there is always a wait. If you're lucky, you can find seating at the bar and order your meal there as well.

I have a few staple favorites that are my go-to's when I come here. I love their four cheese pasta with chicken, the steak diane with salmon and potatoes, and their fried mac n cheese balls. The bread is delicious and unlimited as well. Their cocktails are also always delicious. My favorite cheesecake is the 30th anniversary with layers of cheesecake and chocolate cake topped off with ganache. NOM! I also love the regular topped with strawberries. 

I would recommend eating here for the experience, but just know you will have a wait and you will spend a pretty penny, but you will leave full and satisfied!",2018-06-30 17:03:17

Boy was that a wrong call especially since this is their slowest night! So I complete and pay for my order by 8:01 and was quoted 20 to 25 mins and waited until 8:42 at which point I asked the same take out cashier who had rang me up what was going on she replies waiting on fries and I said well you told me 20 to 25 she replies back I said 25 to 30 I said no but let's go with that then what's taking an extra 15 by the time that banter is done she had no answer except would you like me to get a manager and I replied yes that and the food you said would be ready within the 30 minutes that's now 45 so I wait for him ( Adrian) I believe was his name and after watching him deal with another customer to whole he gave a free slice of cheesecake because I'm guessing resolving yet another dissatisfied customer I unleash a flurry of choice words on their lack of customer service and kitchen performance because 2 hamburgers and a couple of salads do not take 1 hr worth of prepping because the prep boy that came in at 6am already chopped everything up and it's a matter of putting it all in a box. Meanwhile I have a viewership because I have become irate over the lack of concern as the store manager I believe Brandon to be was just watching with a blank stare and I ask him what's he doing and he states just listening to you didn't want to interrupt so I said you'll have to cause I'm long winded. Had nothing to offer so I had him go chase for his business card so I can call corporate or at least email them with first hand insight to their Monday night standards and hope they can improve on it. See the things that makes me so mad, irate or just blow my lid is unlike most people that complain I wasn't looking for ""free"" anything as I always reject such option. That's a band aid on an open wound. What I want is for you to take the time and go look into the issue and fix it and not give me this blank stare like you are surprised to see a customer so upset over a couple of burgers taking an hr to be made. Are you freaking kidding me! I've seen junior chefs make complete meals in an hr and yours can sling out some burgers in 30 mins. Time for training session or new cooks. They're a dime a dozen I'm guessing since it's not a restaurant where you have the liberty to make your menu as you go. Hope this helps you Brandon with what the issue was and you jump on it and get it taken care of. I know it's not the first time service has been lack luster and that's putting it mildly! And to all the staff just being a spectator on the conversation it makes sense why your operation was lacking and why the customer before me got a free dessert from you!",2017-04-04 01:36:46

You expect consistency and at least passable quality when going to a chain establishment, but not the case here at this location. Wednesday night last week stopped in for a late dinner (9PM) after a long day. The server was great very attentive, but unfortunately the same couldn't be said about the kitchen. Ordered Thai Lettuce Wraps  and my friend ordered a burger - one hour in an empty restaurant to grill some chicken - and plate it with lettuce. Kind of crazy, no apology from the waiter on the wait. 

Food finally came out - there were three chicken pieces on the plate - 3 about the size of two of my fingers side by side. - $14 for that? Sauce was missing from the plate and the lettuce was rotting. I wish I would have stopped to talk to a manager, but after a long day all I wanted was to eat and go home especially after an hour wait in a basically empty restaurant.

They were not happy being squeezed into a bench seat with the highchairs etc. but even after they complained to the waitress and the hostess, the hostess seemed unable to come up with a solution.  Seems they could have just moved them to a table where they could move the chairs to accomodate the highchairs.  The menu is overwhelming.  I'm always a little suspicious of a menu with so many items.  I feel like more often than not, everything just ends up being okay and nothing is really good.  My sister ended up getting the burrito and I got the bbq chicken salad.  The burrito was the biggest portion of food I've ever seen in a restaurant.  It could have easily fed 4 adults.

The menu is overwhelming. The space is overwhelming with ceilings that go higher than the sky.  The noise level is too much.  This place is good for groups, if you don't mind waiting in lines, loud conversations, and food that is made for the masses.   GO HERE to meet your friends to have fun.  We DID have fun!  I had the fish tacos and they were good.  The guacamole tasted fresh and the taco was actually really delicious.  But, I was still overwhelmed.   Gosh, now that I think about it, the feeling of being overwhelmed started in the parking lot.  Trying to find a place to park here is not impossible, but nearly impossible.  I was so excited all those years ago when The Cheesecake Factory came to Charlotte. It's amazing at how the years can change us and how we perceive foods and places and even our friends. I think our taste buds change too, over time.   If I could still eat cheesecake without the guilt (as I did 15 or 20 years ago), I would probably be writing a five star review.   As it is, I remain overwhelmed, but will agree that this was good enough for four stars.

The Cheesecake Factory was on her bucket list. Ever since she relocated to North Carolina that's all she's been talking about. I received two tickets to see ""The Space Between Us"" and decided to make the evening a girls night. 

We grabbed dinner then had the most amazing cheesecake! We arrived around 5ish and sat near the bar. At first my niece was overwhelmed with the wide selection of cheesecake. She finally settled on the Oreo Cheesecake. I had the original with strawberries on top. Of course it was DELICIOUS!!!! 
Our waitress Danielle was very patient and kind. 

I've been to this location once before in college. My Mother Loves the food, I'm not a fan. Yes, the cheesecake is good, but the food lacks flavor. Maybe Im ordering the wrong thing. Of course I'm willing to try again for the sake of my niece. Our next adventure will be Brunch.

And probably the only thing that I will eat here as everything is overpriced and the food is just okay. I came here with a group of friends weeks ago for a get together. I just ordered a drink and my brother ordered a cheesecake and calamari which I shared with. The calamari wasn't bad as it was deep fried like any other restaurant that serves calamari.

Cheesecake was wonderful, apple caramel streusel. It was sweet but it wasn't to the point where my mouth was dry (then again I had Long Islands that helped me wash it down.) One of my other friends ordered a burger, and honestly to come here to order a burger isn't really a bright idea. The portions are definitely not worth the amount that you're paying, however this is a ""high class"" restaurant.

And be sure to watch out on the floors. They're super greasy\/slippery, as soon as you walk out of the main area and to your chairs. It seems as if you're walking on some dried oil or grease, it's kind of nasty to not think that they would not mop the floors every night.

My boyfriend and I each got a pasta dish which were very generous portions and both were very very good.

It was good, I ate most of it, but it wasn't exceptional, but to make up for that it was a huge portion and they did not skimp on the quantity of white chicken meat.  The fries were just fries, I think I ate 2.  They did mess up our son's order:  soft tacos with only meat and cheese, everything else on the side.  When they arrived with thinly shredded lettuce throughout the tacos, our waiter pretty much suggested we pull them out. You CANNOT pull out shredded lettuce from a taco...  He did take them back but it took a very long time to replace.  The quality of the taco meat was good though, not the normal ground generic beef.  The mixed drinks looked good, but my husband and I just had a draft beer (only 3 or 4 to choose from, but good choices) bc we were getting ready to spend ALL day shopping in the South Park mall.   I don't mind spending money for exceptional food, but I thought this was just a little over priced for the quality and service.  We would probly go back, but mainly bc the kids loved it so much, not for the quality of the food or value.",2013-04-03 20:17:34

So, first, the obvious... Yes, this place is way over priced. And yes, most dishes have an average of 1,000,000 calories. But, I looked a little harder at their novel of a menu and discovered their ""skinnylicious"" offerings. I question how some of these items (fried samosas, I'm looking at you!) are considered skinnylicious, but I'll let that go for now. 

I ordered the Tuscan Chicken. The menu touts it as less than 590 calories. I wonder how many servings come on the plate though... It had 3 chicken breasts, for crying out loud! Anywho, I ate about half the plate and boxed the rest to go. It was tasty, with LOTS of oven roasted cherry tomatoes, capers, asparagus and artichoke. Expensive at $16.95 though! The price you pay for less calories? Go figure.

Maybe I'm not a fan of this location or maybe I'm not a fan of this chain period, but my last few experiences here have left me disappointed.

One positive thing I can say is that they have an extensive menu.  In general, you would be hard-pressed not to find something you are in the mood to eat.  

However, I've gone in there before and nothing has sounded appetizing - maybe it's just too many selections.  I can say that they have decent (but pricey) salads and I had good fish and chips from there.  I went there with a party and my boss ordered the barbecue salmon, which was WAY too salty for her. This was a day we were out to celebrate a co-worker leaving and had a party of four.  We waited almost 20 minutes to get seated, and then another 20 minutes almost before we could order.  By the time our food had arrived, we had been there over an hour.  This was lunch time, which was frustrating.  Our lunch there lasted over an hour and a half by the time we got dessert.

As far as their cheesecake goes, this has been the biggest disappointment.  It used to be you paid $8 and got huge pieces which were big enough for two to share.  However, my piece last time was about half the size it had been before.  It looks like they are trying to scale back on the sizes.  And when I thought about it, I got one of the specialty cheesecakes and so only about a third of it was actual cheesecake, and the rest of it had toppings woven in.  Not on TOP, as you would expect, but cutting into the piece of cheesecake itself.  The cheesecake part was not as good as it should have been for the price.

This location is swanky and nice, but every time I've been the service was very slow.  And since getting dessert and a lunch special was over $20 at lunch time, it seems a little too pricey for the quality of food and service you get there.  For me, ""meh"" just kind of describes how I feel about this Cheesecake Factory location.",2013-08-28 23:13:43

The Cheesecake Factory is a place of much confusion, but the confusion only testifies to its goodness. 

The atmosphere and architecture can be confused for an Indian palace.

The kind wait staff are indistinguishable from Chick-fil-A employees.

The menu can easily be mistaken for a phonebook. 

The bathrooms parallel dimly lit, royal throne rooms of old. 

The bill has an uncanny resemblance to the U.S. national debt. 

The cheesecake, however, is distinctly unique. It cannot be confused with anything else, for it is the object that other great and wonderful things are confused with. It is, indeed, the magnum opus of the dessert world.",2016-06-19 18:34:27

When it finally did arrive it obviously had been living under a heat lamp for most of the time we waited.  I'm surprised it didn't have mold on it.  My wife ordered the ham and cheese omelet.  The cheese was cooked to a crisp...it resembled peanut brittle.  She actually sent it back because it was nasty.  The waitress agreed it was overcooked and placed an order for another one.  The second one took so long we just cancelled our order.  In the time we waited I asked for a water more than three times.  When we left one of my kids left a bag under the chair with a toy in it.  We returned a few minutes later and my wife asked a waiter if he had seen the bag.  He said ""we already threw it in the trash and threw the trash in the dumpster.""  Assuming the guy just didn't want to look for it she said ""so you can't get it back?"" He said ""what do you want me to do, go dumpster diving?""  Besides the fact the waiter was a complete jerk I'm shocked they managed to empty the trash 100x faster than they could deliver the food we ordered.

BlJ6Opt_JUFzJf_aYG3LFQ,H5kjbtCQH1eKyWdTaspmzg,L8rJht4Jw_BuR8gsckEWYg,4.0,1,0,0,"Me and my family visited The Cheesecake Factory for the first time tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  First off, we are not from Charlotte and we do not have a Cheesecake factory near our house.  We are Big Bang Theory super fans so when we saw it we knew we had to try it.   If you are like us and have never been or saw one other than on the show, then you will be in for a big surprise too!  

Atmosphere:  We arrived around 8:30pm on a Sunday night.  The wait was minimal even though it was pretty busy.  We requested outside seating since it was a perfect night for it, and were escorted right out.  Tables were nice, and had a small candle on it for a nice little touch.  The building the restaurant is located in is very nice as well.  Very upscale looking and a classy place overall.  Much different vibe and style than was in the show.  ( Hang with me through the BBT show comments, I am sure others are wondering the same as we were. )  8\/10

Menu and Price Point:  As most others have mentioned the menu is very very extensive.  You would be really hard pressed to not find something that you like.  Very detailed which I like because I am a picky eater, and nicely laid out considering the size of the menu.  As for price, I got the Penne, My wife got the Chicken and Biscuits (think chicken pot pie), and my daughter just wanted cheese sticks.  We also got 1 piece of the Oreo Dream cheesecake and the total bill was 53.00 and some change.  Not too bad considering the portions are huge and the food was very tasty.  7\/10

Service:  When we first walked in the greeter was not super friendly like most places of that caliber but, when we were seated things changed.  Our waiter was extremely nice and super helpful.  He was very attentive despite being pretty busy, and took the time to talk to us and offer suggestions.  He even addressed my daughter who is 10, which most of the time wait staff just look at us for her order.  I liked that and i think she did too.  8\/10

Food:  The food was very good.  Like i mentioned above my daughter got an appetizer for her main meal which was the Cheesesticks.  She liked them and even made the comment she wished there was more.  On a couple they were overcooked a little but she didnt complain and just peeled off the coating.  My wife had the Chicken and Biscuits and she really enjoyed it and gives it a 8\/10.  She could only eat about half a quarter of it due to the sheer amount she was given.  I got the Penne Pasta, and it was cooked perfect for me.  It was a little short on sauce but really was very tasty.  I did add a little salt, and I asked the waiter for some Parmesan cheese and he brought out a block and grated some fresh for me right at the table.  Im a big guy and I couldn't eat it all due to the portion size.  8\/10 for me on the pasta.  

I will definitely be back for me on my next visit.  

P.S.... Haven't tried the cheesecake yet but its a massive slice.",2013-07-29 02:58:19

Any other time we have gone, the food is always okay but pricey and we always get two pieces of cheesecake to share. This time around, my husband ordered the meatloaf lunch and when he got it, the meatloaf was dry and he compared it to chow hall food in the military. He said chow hall food was better than that! When the waiter came back like 15 minutes later, I told him that the food as gross. He took it away and never said a word. The manager popped up about 10 minutes later and offered him a menu but told him that everyone's tastes are different and they have never had a complaint about the meatloaf before. My thoughts were, ""it's dry and tough....Who would eat that?"" My husband just ordered a soup and salad lunch combo after he got another menu which was priced at like $15. The salad was horrible and the soup tasted like vegetable water almost. When our waiter came to the table, of course I had to be the one to call out the issues because my husband won't and I didn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't eat. Of course they did nothing about it. They just brought out the cheesecake and made us pay for a meal he did not eat or enjoy.

The menu is a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for. 

The menu is also HUGE. Part of that monstrosity is advertisements (annoying!) but there really is a ton to choose from.

I have weekly (if not daily) day dreams about the Avocado Egg Rolls. Holy moly this appetizer rocks my world! Yes, it's an appetizer, but I actually order it as my entree, whoops. These rolls are chocked full of crazy amounts of flavor and texture. The middle is gooey and savory and the outside is crispy and delicious. And the dipping sauce, some sort of cilantro chutney... SHUT UP! It's amazing.

I also really enjoy the Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes appetizer. These little babies are sweet and salty at the same time. Very filling. Nice presentation.

My favorite appetizer salad is the French Country Salad. Veggie friendly and delish.

The only thing I've had here I have NOT enjoyed was Evelyn's Favorite Pasta. It's pretty boring and lackluster, I do not recommend.

And last but definitely not least, their namesake... the CHEESECAKES. Oh lord. Yes, It's okay to come here just for cheesecake. No one will judge you.

Avocado egg rolls are perfect. Crispy exterior and soft flavorful interior. I like it dipped in their homemade ranch better than the sweet dipping sauce the egg rolls come with. 

Chili Rellenos were somewhat disappointing. The hot, melty pepper jack cheese inside is awesome, but the pepper has a very green pepper flavor rather than any spiciness. The crunchy fried outside is good but overall this was a miss for me. Not really worth the calories. 

The veggie burger was made with beets (along with brown rice, farro and black bean) and was not good at all. It was cold and sweet and bland. 

You can't go wrong with any of the desserts. We had the banana cream cheesecake, which is our standby favorite.

The interior is nicely decorated, but it felt very dim when I in to eat.  I'd prefer a little more lighting there for some reason.  I thought that they could have someone make the bathroom a little cleaner though.  When I went in on Sunday, I was seated at a big circle booth.

We've been coming to CF for years, all over the country for several reasons.  One, variety of the menu.  Two, consistency.  Three, convenience.  You don't go to CF for its uniqueness or specialty menu, you go because you know exactly what you (should) be getting . . . This local CF failed at 2 out of 3 tonight. 

Convenience: 30-45 minute wait at 5:50 pm on Sunday that was every bit of 45 minutes, yet plenty of open tables in our section.  Understaffed perhaps.  Followed by excessively slow service.  Forgotten items (missed an app and a side), too long to take orders, too long to bus the table, if at all mid service.  Water refills nonexistent.  This is restaurant 101 stuff.

Consistency: failed here too.  Steak undercooked and cold (credit where due, at least it wasn't overcooked), menu items I've had elsewhere simply not the same (a cardinal sin of the dreaded chain restaurant), and in one case the dish was served with a significantly different setup than described on the menu.  All prepared with minimal adequacy.  It was edible but nothing remarkable or even good by CF standards.

Saw another table leave in frustration after walking up to the service station for a drink refill for the same reasons: slow, incompetent service.

I guess what this Cheesecake Factory has going for it is an anchor location in the local high end mall and a captured audience.  They simply do not need to perform at restaurant fundamentals to continue as a business, people will still fill the place up.  Which is a shame, because CFs can be quite good, when they're not failing at basic functions.

Do yourselves a favor and walk over to many of the other almost as close options so this store can just end it already and give up the space to someone who will execute as if they care about their customers.",2016-09-26 01:18:28

Wait staff has always been on point and very attentive. Several times our servers have informed us on options that we were not previously aware of such as paying our bill through the iPhone App, new available Cheesecake options, and even pointing us to the bar for their happy hour specials. 

I would give this location a five star rating but there is one issue I have, consistency. The last couple of times we have gone to do the happy hour in the bar area, our apps that were ordered were different in taste each time. My favorite app are the potstickers, but I ordered them three times and all three time they were different. One time they were overdone, next time they were overloaded with the sauce, third time they were near perfect.  Same type of deal has happened with entrees ordered where one time my meatloaf was dry and the next time was slightly undercooked. 

My only negative is the consistency of the food sent out. Other than that, this location of Cheesecake Factory is a great one.",2017-08-06 20:24:32

The food is amazing as well as their fantastic cheesecakes. There's a large variety so there really is a little something for everyone.

However, I've come to realize that I have the same issues almost every time I come as far as the amount of time I'm waiting on food\/service. 

Today I happened to want to surprise my family with some cheesecake and tried calling ahead numerous times to put in a to go order and no one picked up the phone. I understood and shrugged thinking that it must be busy. I am a server and working in the food\/restaurant industry has given me a very forgiving perspective. Come to find that when I walk in the door, it is completely dead and the hostess is letting the phone ring nonstop without picking it up.

Hostess, Bartender and Server not so much!  I get that this is a busy restaurant and the Host\/Hostess are met everyday probably with giving people long wait times, but being pleasant goes a long way. When you immediately start fidgeting with your computer screen punching in buttons with a stressed frown on your face, thankful our parents who have never been to Cheesecake Factory didn't have to endure this rude greeting.  Next, it's on to the bar for a couple glasses of wine and a virgin daquiri (we told the bartender before we ordered we would make it worth his while :)  -- expected that to get a little friendly response.  No instead an abrupt stomp off to make it.  Comes back we ask for a wine list and bartender seems annoyed we are not ordering food.  Ask about the house chardonnay and he tells me it""s compared to Beringer--blick!  That's a first!  So we get our wine and settle up immediately, we were going to hang out, but we felt very unwelcome here.  Decide to sit outside for the rest of our wait, the seating outside is really nice and it was a nice night.  Finally, the buzzer rings and it's on to dinner.  Waiter is pleasant enough but, seems frazzled and not overly friendly.  Takes our drink orders, brings them back with bread basket.  Takes our order and app order.   App comes out, probably good time to make sure everyone has drinks still... nope.  He disappears then, apparently at this restaurant there are no food runners so, the waiter is also responsible for getting your food out to you too.  Seems like a BIG mistake to me--unless your organized and a good waiter\/waitress.   We were a party of 6 and like I said first time our parents had ever been here and we were hoping to treat them to a good evening.  So half of our party got our food right away, the other half waited and waited (typically at most restaurants when food comes out seperate like that it is expected that the rest of the tables food is coming up right?).  We saw our waiter take another order, before he got the rest of our food.  No checkback really, and definitely no drink refills, unless  you count the time I flagged him down.  When our waiter finally came back to the table, ingredients from my salad were missing, had to get waiter to go ask for those items.  

Like I said food was good enough and cheesecake was awesome, but for what you pay to eat at this place and the wait, you expect better service!

So many options, unusual options on the menu, servers galore and looking up to the ceiling and across the restaurant you get such wild ambiance.  Kids and adults enjoy the atmosphere and loud children cannot be heard more than two tables away because the Cheesecake Factory hums.

Your menu is a spiral-bound book.  Take your time and get lost in the offerings.  

Beware the ""skinny"" options.  Yes, they are low calorie and low fat, but to me they are so lacking in flavor and substance that one would have to be on a very strict diet to be subjected to the skinny life.  

Otherwise, far from the skinny life are many wonderful salads, sandwiches and entrees.  Iced tea is endless and refills are prompt.  The bread is crusty and warm.  I especially liked their soups with the bread.

The way the tables are positioned, all of the vegetation, and not to mention the ceiling is amazing. I don't like the little tables though, there really isn't enough room for 2 people and all the dinnerware, it seems crowded.

The food? Fantastic! I have eaten here many times and I try to get something different every time I go and I have not been disappointed. The crusted chicken romano is a must, so is the stuffed chicken marsala. For some reason, when I've had a dish with marsala sauce, it seems over powering with the wine, but not at Cheesecake Factory. They get it just right to where you can taste the mushrooms and other flavors with your meal. Their garlic mashed potatoes are to die for! They use red potatoes instead of russet or yellow potatoes. The texture is a little lumpy, yet smooth all at the same time. 

Let's not forget their cheesecake. That's the reason why you came right? There are 2 pages of cheesecake selections in the menu. All of their cheesecake is wonderful, but make sure you have a glass of water or milk handy because most of their cheesecakes are RICH! They range from your traditional cheesecake with strawberries to a carrot cake cheesecake. If you're a peanut butter fan like myself, fear not, they have about 3 different kind of cheesecake with peanut butter. Let's not forget their carrot cake!! The 1st time I had their carrot cake was at Barnes & Nobles and it was like my mom used to make. Dreamy!

As for the wait, be prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the weekend at least and during the week about 10-15 minutes to get seated. Never have I gone to the restaurant and gotten seated immediately. It's well worth the wait and what better way to wait at the bar? I'm a Long Island kind of girl, but I have had their cranberry and vodka. Their liquor is all top shelf and I always had a well mixed drink, nothing overpowering in 1 liquor. 

The wait staff is knowledgeable and very polite. I've had only 1 server that was pretty bad, but that was because we were his last table and we were taking our sweet time. Yes, it's still not an excuse to be rude and try to rush people out, but overall, I haven't had really bad service.

Cons: 
Long wait to be seated.
Noise, sometimes can't hear what your company is saying to you across the table from you.

It was no better and no worse than any other chain joint but significantly higher priced than something like a Sagebrush or Applebys and not better quality.  Five-star prices, three-star quality, one-star service is the best way to describe it.  My date ordered the shrimp and mushroom dish which was served with no mushrooms.  I order the ribeye which was slightly overcooked (ordered medium rare - served medium).  The worst part was definitely service.  Our waiter disappeared for extended periods of time and in fact, never checked on the food which was delivered to the table by someone from the kitchen (I assume), so we never had the chance to explain that the dishes were not exactly correct (I was okay with the steak, but my date specifically wanted the mushrooms in the ""shimp and MUSHROOMS"" dish.  We waited over 30 minutes for the check and another 15 for the cheesecake to-go (which I order before the check).  I will say that the cheesecake was delicious later that night.

-That wide variety of menu items you know and love from CF, including a nice selection of lunch portions (and lunch prices). 
-Friendly staff. Something I miss once I moved to the DMV.
-Quality ingredients, and tasty food. I ordered the lunch grilled salmon with broccoli and mashed potatoes for $13.95. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. Other dishes ordered at the table included a cheeseburger, cobb salad, and chicken wings. All were devoured. 
-Food presentation is great. I love the way they serve the dishes to you with thought and care.
-Happy Birthday! My cheesecake plate had Happy Birthday written on it, with a pink candle for me to blow out! They also sang Happy Birthday to me. Ahh never gets old even in my late 20's!

*Cons*
-My broccoli was served cold. I mean ice cold. 
-The fountain drinks all tasted flat no matter what you ordered.
-When my husband ordered after dinner coffee, and she asked if he wanted a refill she did not tell him refills were not free. Normally, they leave the pot, or bring the pot over and fill 'er up. Nope, he was charged another $3 bucks for black coffee. Party foul!

All in all a great birthday lunch with good times and good food.",2014-06-10 01:17:38

I had been years earlier with friends of mine and I said that time I had to have my mother try this place as well. I told her she would be in store for a great treat and that's what she got.

As we entered this place to put our name the list for a table, the line was out the door and there were many patrons sitting outside in the nice sitting area for there name to be called as well. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table. That was fine since we didn't have anywhere in particular to go this Saturday afternoon. 

The 30 minutes came and went fast by us people watching others going in and coming out of the mall. Once we turned in our buzzer it was still a 5 minute wait to get seated still. We finally were placed in a busy, small corner of the restaurant by the hostess. This was cool because it was just 2 of us and enough space for both of us.

Our waitress came and introduced herself within minutes of us sitting down. We looked over the menu for awhile. After bringing our drinks the waitress informed us that she was leaving for the day and another waitress would handled us from here on out. This was fine as long as we still got top notch service.

The menu was filled with all kinds of things, chicken, pasta, hamburgers, and things like that. I had a very hard trying to choose what I wanted to eat. It was either the Parmesan chicken or the Seafood pasta. I ended up choosing the chicken and my mother chose the 'glamburger'. Both were great choices. My dish came with 3 chicken breasts, green beans, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were out of this world!!!!! They were absolutely amazing. The chicken and green beans were good but I couldn't get enough of the potatoes. My mother enjoyed her hamburger and fries. It was a pretty big burger too. We both had tons to take home. 

Then came the dessert!!! How could you go to this restaurant and not order cheesecake?!?!?!?!?!? I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake but I do love a Strawberry cheesecake and that's what I got and my mother ordered the Key Lime cheesecake. Only complaint I have about my cheesecake is the bottom crust. I didn't particularly care of it but the rest was delicious.

My mother really enjoyed this little dinner we had!!! I'm so glad that I was able to have her dine here with me for the first time!!! I'm sure this won't be her last because she is now HOOKED!!!! I'm sure she would want me to take care of the tab again also!!!! LOL!!!!",2015-10-05 10:18:59

Upon getting ""beeped"" I approached the front counter where I was confronted with YOUR POLICY that made YOUR HOSTESS RUDE. She informed me that ""policy"" said we could not be seated because all 6 of us were not there. Two were at the bar closing out our check and one was in the mall because as a 73 year old, he needed to sit. YOU do not have anywhere near the seating needed for waiting guests.

Are you kidding? Do you really expect everyone to be there immediately upon beeping after three long hours? My lord, I wonder why the fire marshals have not ordered you to clear the doorway of scores of people waiting to be seated. Your food staff had huge difficulty navigating the immense crowd. Think guest safety. When Saturday night crowds are big and it is 10 degrees outside, perhaps you can isolate a better waiting area.

Everything about The Cheesecake Factory gets high marks but not your corporate policies or customer accommodation  (therefore the 2 stars as an average for food vs. ""policy"").

Sadly, I live in Columbia, SC, and this is the closest Cheesecake Factory to where I live.  My sister loves it here (well mainly for their cheesecakes), so we decided to make a small road trip up here several days ago.

Unlike the name suggests, you can order more than cheesecakes here.  Even though we were originally going to have lunch here, we decided just to stick with cheesecake for dessert. Looking at their menu (briefly might I add and going on when I actually did have dinners here), you can get your typical dinners here (chicken, stekas, pizza) and price wise, it is the about the same as other dinner places you might go to.  The menu does seem overwhelming (as we were only looking for desserts) as this particular location was also running ads for other businesses in the area (not aure if all locations do this as well).

I used to love Cheesecake Factory. I mean I would find any excuse to go here...but after a while things changed, the food was different and I stopped going. And then my friends came to visit from Virginia and where did they wanna go????  Our good old standby...of course! 

And here we go:

Drinks: 
My favorite for a long time has been their Georgia Peach. Vodka, Peach liquor swirled with raspberries and topped with a mint leaf so it looks like a peach in a glass. Perfect! Always delicious, and most certainly expect to order two! Mmmmmm! 

Appetizers:
We ordered the wings without the sauce. They were okay. A little dry but we just doused them in blue cheese and ranch. There are plenty of other options so unless you're craving wings try something else. We also ordered the Buffalo Blasts. Now these things are freaking delicious! It's chicken, cheese and buffalo sauce stuffed in a wonton and fried. You can always sign me up for anything with the words ""fried, chicken and cheese"" in the description. They were ahhhhmazing! Crispy on the outside juicy flavorful meat stuffed on the inside (and they are not stingy with the filling) served hot with ranch dressing...like Nike says Just Do It! You can thank me later! 

Dinner: 
I ordered the Herb Crusted Salmon. It comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus over a lemon sauce. I'm a huge fan of the lemon sauce (always ask for extra) but last night the salmon just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, portion size was not the issue. But it was just very bland. The potatoes are chunky with pieces of the red skin, not a favorite for me but that's just my personal preference. The asparagus was cooked perfectly and dipped in the lemon sauce....simply divine! 

Overall, the meal was just okay. Nowhere near as good as I used to remember but not bad by any means. I'm sure I'll be back...and yes I'll make sure to get a piece of cheesecake.",2013-09-28 17:48:08

We all know Cheesecake Factory... big portions. An extensive menu. Stark white shirts that I have no clue how every server keeps them bright white all shift. But have you ever been by for happy hour?! Best in Charlotte. Hands down. 

Post up at the bar (HH only at the bar) and grab a menu. About a dozen different options, all from the Cheesecake Factory's regular appetizer menu all for $5 each. Chris and I decided to get the tex mex eggrolls and the buffalo blasts. They delivered the dishes and damnnn... full-sized plates. And if you've ever been to CCF you know how much food that is - and for $5! I couldn't believe it wasn't smaller HH portions!

The buffalo blasts were piled high - 8 to the plate. And is a crispy, fluffy, deep fried pocket. Bite in and it is filed with juicy grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce. And as a huge lover of all things spicy, I was in love. I recommend with sour cream. Awesome cooling effect to the buffalo. We ended up eating 3 of the blasts and 4 out of the 6 eggrolls. Packed a to-go box and left highly satisfied. 

Only downside, I work in Uptown and the happy hour here goes from 4 to 6pm.

Overall, the Cheesecake Factory is good but highly overrated. Parking is convenient as there is a small lot, as well as the deck. There is valet but it looked as through they are only available at dinner time. I just wish they would update their pedestrian crossing section because if you park in the deck, you risk getting hit by the fast cars turning around the corner. There also isn't a sidewalk that wraps around the outside so you have to walk in the street until you reach said sidewalk. 

The wine I ordered with my lunch was at a good temperature for a sparkling white, which was extremely refreshing. The wine and cocktail prices were on par with competitors in the area. They didn't have any specials, if that's what you're looking for.

The food was honestly better than I expected. I went for the lunch special and ordered the herb crusted salmon. It was properly cooked with no complaints. It wasn't wowing but it wasn't terrible either. 

Because of my diet, or ""lifestyle change"", I declined the cheesecake.

I didn't mind waiting for 1 hr 15 mins and didn't mind the fading lights. Lights were very dim to read the menu comfortably but I didn't mind as I knew what I wanted to order. I always start with Avocado egg rolls as they are my favorite. However they weren't as crispy as I have had them earlier, it seemed they were sitting on the kitchen counter for around 10 mins after being fried. Which resulted in the lack of crispness. 

For the entree I wished to try a new item, the ratatouille toast. The presentation was beautiful and appetizing. The ratatouille was delightful however the toast was burnt and very dry. It was hard to eat but thinking about my prior experience with Cheesecake Factory I gave it a go hoping that the next piece would be better. But I realized it was hopeless cause. This was reported to the manager and he offered to replace it but by then I just lost my appetite. He took it off the bill which was a kind gesture. I wouldn't have mind paying for it as its all about the having a good experience.

For desserts it was lemoncello cream torte, which is a masterpiece. Refreshing lemon mascarpone cheese sandwiched between moist vanilla cake topped with streusel.",2016-05-29 08:05:10

I'm still salty at them for getting rid of the pineapple upside down cheesecake.  I'm still in rehab!  Visited for lunch.  All the staff I encountered were pleasant and my waitress was very good.  I ordered the pepperoni pizza, which was thin crust.  It tasted really good, but  I prefer a crispy crust.  If your style is the floppy New York Pizza style, you will really enjoy it.  For dessert I had the strawberry shortcake.  I will not order it again, as the cake part is actually biscuits, hard biscuits.  Maybe if it was a lighter fluffier biscuit I would have enjoyed it.  They did have a skinny side menu, which I thought was nice.

When I'm forced to eat here I enjoy the small plates menu items which include the avocado rolls, salmon rolls & mushroom pizza. Our teenager ALWAYS indulge in the Buffalo Blast as an app and chicken tenders with fries as a main course. The hubby alternates between Jamaican Black Bean chicken and the Miso Salmon. I personally LOVE the Miso however this location is off on flavor and the whole Miso experience. 

It's pretty weird that Grand Luxe Cafe and Cheesecake Factory are owned by the same company. I prefer Grand Luxe as its much more upscale and the food options are better and much more tasty and presented better. Grand Luxe would've been a perfect fit for SouthPark mall, wishful thinking as I'm a Chicago girl and we have it ALL.

The dessert choices include the Lemon cake\/cheesecake, the red velvet cheesecake and the chocolate cake.

Cheesecake Factory is great for dates, brunch (HUGE omelets), girl's night out and business meetings.

Despite the extra dim atmosphere and lack of customers, I still found a bug in my salad, the spaghetti, and meatball (came with only 1 small meatball) was raw in the middle, and the steak tacos ordered were actually chicken. When asked if one person wanted cheese on their meal, they very clearly and politely said, ""no thank you"" were acknowledged, and the waitress still returned with a spoonful of cheese that she carelessly dumped on his meal anyway. A manager came by and acknowledged that the steak was actually chicken without us mentioning it, but just offered to charge us for the chicken instead. Aside from the bug, the lettuce wraps had rotten and dried out cabbage that is not edible and the hot fudge Sunday we ordered to celebrate our reason for being there was nearly all whipped cream with a separate dish of hot fudge that looked and felt more like a lumpy coagulated clot sitting in a pool of clear oil. It was not pourable, and did not even appear safe for to eat. I would absolutely not recommend this location.  Despite the issues that the waitress was aware of( the raw meatball, and the wrong order) we still were charged and paid full price.",2018-11-06 14:54:49

I knew it was going to be expensive when I saw the 40 ft high ceilings. Someone has to pay for all this air. 

The noise level is amazing. I could barely hear the bartender when I ordered a drink. As I sat there sipping on a glass of wine I noticed massive portions of food being served. I saw salads that could feed a village in Afghanistan.

What is with the massive portions? I ordered an Angus burger that had to be 3\/4lb to 1 lb,  loaded with onions and mushrooms. The place is also pricey but then............

It finally hit me. When you go to the Cheesecake factory you order an entree you want to eat at your next two meals. So you really need to focus on which items are a good for reheating  and taste good as leftovers.

By spreading the meal over two or three meals makes the high prices seem very reasonable. So this is why people wait 45 minutes to 2 hours to eat at the Cheesecake factory.",2010-03-11 01:14:09

There is almost ALWAYS a wait at this location, no matter the time. We arrived around 1230 and told a 20 minute wait, it was around 25. I am in love with the asian lettuce tacos and the pear, blue cheese and pecan flatbread on the skinnylicious menus. Friend had the chopped salad also off the skinnylicious menu... we were both in heaven and had leftovers. The service was good and the food came out quickly... it helps having an idea of what you want before you go because the menu is huge.",2012-08-14 19:21:19

It is a must to get if you are an avocado lover. The green sauce that comes with was sweet and tasty. Carbonara with chicken was creamy and rich. Grilled salmon was okay.

It was very busy with many people waiting for a seat... So being on my own I chose to sit at the bar. Roland, one of the bartenders, made me one of the best Long Island Ice teas (top shelf) that I've ever had. The woman next to me tried (some sort of) peach drink and she seemed to really like it. I watched them making Mojitos and decided that I'd definitely get one of those on my next visit. 
   The Asian sesame cauliflower was really good and I fell off the diet wagon with some of the Peanut butter cup cheesecake. 

Give Cheesecake Factory a try if you're at South Park Mall.. they'll give you a buzzer so you can browse the mall while waiting on a table",2018-10-20 23:42:54

The appetizers alone are always banging and who doesn't like free bread ??? Let's take a moment and notice the menu options are vast , the prices as well but come on there's more than enough food given to keep you satisfied and not too hurt on the $$. If you are a cheese cake fan they have one for every person . I simply can't get enough of the potstickers , the sauce is heavenly . Minus the long waits , it's not a horrible restaurant ... Try the Jamaican black pepper shrimp , or the Kobe burger , maybe in the mood for egg rolls , both the Tex mex and avocado are delicious .",2015-08-04 19:28:46
